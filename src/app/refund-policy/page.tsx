          </h2>
          <p>
            There might be certain orders that Course Unbox cannot process and
            must subsequently cancel. Course Unbox retains the right to reject
            or annul any order for any reason.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Situations that may result in cancellation include, but are not
            limited to, product unavailability or insufficient quantities,
            lack of service availability, errors in pricing information, or
            issues identified by our credit and fraud prevention team.

          <p className="mt-3">
            Course Unbox may also request additional verification or
            information before approving an order. If all or part of your
            order is canceled, or if further details are required, you will be
            notified accordingly.
